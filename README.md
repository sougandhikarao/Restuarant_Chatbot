The chatbots helped the business to scale its marketing and customer support sector. Even though the chatbots existed for a long time the technology behind chatbots varied tremendously from simple rule based to using complex artificial intelligence. In this project the aim is to build an intelligent chatbot capable of human-like conversation in restaurant specific domains. For any machine learning model data plays a vital role in determining the performance, custom data is generated using different techniques like surveys and logs.Furthermore, data is augmented using Bert models. A rich-media intelligence chatbot is developed using  memory-based attention model like Deep Attention Model with Bi-LSTM.The chatbot is developed with a hybrid model using Knowledge graph with NLP and deep attention model. Moreover, the chatbot is integrated with audio and media where the customer can speak with a mic symbol in the UI and the customer can request images of the dishes and how they look and a chatbot can show the images. The chatbot is tested and validated quantitatively and qualitatively and achieves high performance metrics.
